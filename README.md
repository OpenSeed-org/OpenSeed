# OpenSeed

**OpenSeed** is an open-source hardware project for secure, durable, and offline backup of Bitcoin seed phrases.
A decentralized and sovereign alternative to commercial solutions.

The project provides 3D-printable designs to be manufactured in metal and engraved using a simple spring-loaded center punch.  
All designs use **binary encoding** of BIP39 words — no visible letters or numbers are stored on the plate.
