**OpenSeed** is an open-source hardware project for secure, durable, and offline backup of Bitcoin seed phrases.
A decentralized and sovereign alternative to commercial solutions.

The project provides 3D-printable designs to be manufactured in metal and engraved using a simple spring-loaded center punch.  
All designs use [**binary encoding**](../../docs/Bip39-Binary.pdf) of BIP39 words — no visible letters or numbers are stored on the plate.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. Go to the [`/designs/`](./designs) folder.  
2. Choose the plate variant that best suits your needs.  
3. Download the STL and print it via a metal 3D printing services (JLC3DP, Craftcloud, Shapeways).
4. Use a spring-loaded center punch to encode your seed in binary.
