# OpenSeed 🔐🛠️

**OpenSeed** is a free and open-source project that provides 3D printable designs for durable, metal seed phrase storage. It is designed to be sovereign, low-cost, and resistant — an alternative to commercial solutions for securing Bitcoin private keys.

---

## 🔧 Project Goals

- 🔓 **Free and open** – No paywalls, no proprietary designs.
- 🧱 **Resilient** – Optimized for metal 3D printing (steel, titanium).
- 🧠 **Standards compliant** – Supports BIP39 (12/24-word seed phrases).
- 🛠️ **DIY-friendly** – Designed to be fabricated via accessible services like JLC3DP, Craftcloud, or local 3D print shops.
- 🧍 **User-sovereign** – No reliance on centralized services or companies.

## 📂 Repository structure

- `/designs` – 3D models (.STL, .STEP) ready for printing.
- `/docs` – Guides, printing instructions, safety recommendations.
- `/variants` – Experimental or specialized versions (e.g. passphrase support).

## ⚙️ Printing suggestions

- **Material:** Stainless steel or titanium recommended.
- **Thickness:** Minimum 3–4mm for durability.
- **Services:** JLC3DP, Craftcloud, Shapeways, etc.
- **Layout:** Optimized for laser engraving, stamping, or manual marking.
