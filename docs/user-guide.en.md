# OpenSeed User Guide 🇬🇧

This guide explains how to use the OpenSeed system to securely back up a BIP39 seed phrase using a metal plate encoded in binary with a punch tool.

## 🧱 What is OpenSeed?

**OpenSeed** is an open-source hardware project. It provides downloadable 3D models you can print in metal enabling you to create a durable, offline backup of your Bitcoin seed phrase.

The design is fire-resistant, waterproof, and fully offline. It is meant to be printed in stainless steel using 3D metal printing services.

---

## 🔧 What you need

- ✅ A 3D-printed OpenSeed plate (see instructions below)
- ✅ A **spring-loaded automatic center punch** (no hammer needed)
- ✅ Your 12 or 24-word BIP39 seed phrase

---

## 🏗️ How to print the OpenSeed plate

1. **Download the STL file**  
   OpenSeed will offer multiple variants  available in the `/designs` folder of this repository.

2. **Use a 3D printing service**  
   Upload the file to a metal 3D printing provider such as:
   - [JLC3DP](https://jlc3dp.com/)
   - [Craftcloud](https://craftcloud3d.com/)
   - [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/)

3. **Recommended print specs**
   - **Material:** Stainless Steel 316L
   - **Finish:** Raw metal (no polish needed)

## ✍️ Marking your seed

The plate uses a **binary encoding scheme** based on the BIP39 word list.

Each word in your seed phrase corresponds to a binary index (1–2048). You will punch the corresponding pattern on the plate using the automatic center punch.

> A visual marking guide will be included with each design variant.

---

## 🛡️ Safety guidelines

- Store the plate in a secure location (safe, hiding place, deposit box)
- Keep your punch tool separate from the plate
- Do not photograph, scan, or digitally store your seed
- If using a BIP39 passphrase, store it separately and securely
