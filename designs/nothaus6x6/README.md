# Nothaus6x6 Design

**Nothaus6x6** is a compact variant of the OpenSeed project.  

It is designed for portability and discretion, making it suitable for situations where space is limited or a smaller backup is preferred.  
The design encodes words in **binary** using a spring-loaded center punch.

## 🔧 Specifications

- **Shape:** Circular
- **Diameter:** 30 mm
- **Capacity:** 12 seed words (6 per side)

## 📐 Options for use with a 12-word seedphrase

- Use **Side A** for words 1–6 and **Side B** for words 7–12.  
- In the case of an irreversible error on one of the sides, the plate will be unusable for a 12-word password. If you prefer a plate with greater redundancy, we have the Nothaus12x12, with a 38 mm diameter design that fits 12 words per side (24 words in total).

## 📐 Options for use with a 24-word seedphrase

- Not enough capacity for full 24-word seedphrases.  
- For full 24-word coverage, see the [Nothaus12x12](../nothaus12x12) or [Nothaus24x24](../nothaus24x24) designs.

## ⚙️ Recommended printing

- **Material:** Stainless Steel 316L or Titanium
- **Finish:** Raw metal (no polish required)  
- **Method:** 3D metal printing via services such as JLC3DP, Craftcloud, or Shapeways

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Print the plate using a metal 3D printing service.  
2. Use a **spring-loaded center punch** to mark each bit according to your BIP39 seed.  
3. Store the finished plate securely, away from cameras and digital devices.
