# Nothaus6x6 Design

**Nothaus6x6** is a compact variant of the OpenSeed project.  

It is designed for portability and discretion, making it suitable for situations where space is limited or a smaller backup is preferred.  
The design encodes words in **binary** using a spring-loaded center punch.

## üîß Specifications

- **Shape:** Circular
- **Diameter:** 30 mm
- **Capacity:** 12 seed words (6 per side)
- **Bits per row:** 12 (enough to represent all 2048 words in the BIP39 list)
- **Lines per side:** 6 curved rows
- **Markings:**
  - Central engraved mark on one side to indicate "Side A"
  - Shallow central hole for orientation
- **Surface:** Slightly concave to reduce abrasion and protect against wear

## üìê Options for use with a 12-word seedphrase

- Use **Side A** for words 1‚Äì6 and **Side B** for words 7‚Äì12.  
- In the case of an irreversible error on one of the sides, the plate will be unusable for a 12-word password. If you prefer a plate with greater redundancy, we have the Nothaus12x12, with a 38 mm diameter design that fits 12 words per side (24 words in total).

## üìê Options for use with a 24-word seedphrase

- Not recommended for full 24-word phrases due to capacity.  
- Can be used as a **partial backup** (e.g., first 12 words only).  
- For full 24-word coverage, see the [Nothaus12x12](../nothaus12x12) or [Nothaus24x24](../nothaus24x24) designs.

> A printable PDF guide will be provided to illustrate the orientation and binary layout.
